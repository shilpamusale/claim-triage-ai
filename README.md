> **ClaimTriageAI** is an ML-powered microservice for automating healthcare claim denial prediction, uncovering root causes through NLP-based clustering, and intelligently routing high-priority claims to resolution teams using reinforcement learning-inspired policies.

---

## Project Overview

**ClaimTriageAI** simulates real-world **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** workflows and serves as a full-stack ML engineering showcase. It enables:

- Predicting whether a claim will be denied and why
  - For model details and evaluation, see the 
- Clustering denied claims into root causes using sentence embeddings
  - For model details and evaluation, see the .
- Routing high-complexity claims to the right team using contextual features
  - For model details and evaluation, see the

📄 Model Cards
- [Denial Prediction Model Card](docs/model_card.md)
  - Detailed breakdown of model inputs, outputs, metrics, and retraining strategy.

- [Root Cause Clustering Model Card](docs/model_card_cluster.md)
  - Explains the Sentence-BERT + UMAP + HDBSCAN clustering pipeline with real output structure.

- [Routing Policy Engine Card](docs/model_card_policy.md)
  - Describes the priority scoring logic and YAML-driven queue assignment engine.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Denial Prediction**  
  Uses XGBoost/LightGBM models trained on structured claim + EHR data.

- **Root Cause Clustering**  
  Embeds denial reasons with Sentence-BERT and applies UMAP + HDBSCAN to discover latent denial drivers.

- **Routing Engine**  
  Applies an offline-RL-inspired policy to prioritize A/R workflows based on claim metadata, denial cluster, and team skills.

- **FastAPI Inference API**  
  Modular endpoints for predicting denial, clustering root causes, and suggesting routing actions.

- **CI/CD + MLOps Ready**  
  Integrated testing, type checks, and style checks with `pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`, `black`, and GitHub Actions from day one.

## API Usage (FastAPI)

### 🔹 POST /api/fullroute
Submit a CSV file of claims to trigger the full triage pipeline:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/fullroute \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your_claims.csv"
```
- Input: CSV with claims (columns: claim_id, cpt_code, diagnosis_code, payer_id, etc.)
- Output: JSON list with denial probability, top denial reasons, cluster ID, priority score, and recommended queue.

## Sample Inference (via JSON)

```json
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "claim_id": "12345",
    "cpt_code": "99213",
    "diagnosis_code": "E11.9",
    "payer_id": "AETNA",
    "provider_type": "Cardiologist"
  }'

```
  - ### Response
            ```json
            {
              "denial_probability": 0.82,
              "top_denial_reasons": ["Medical Necessity", "Prior Auth Missing"],
              "model_version": "v1.0.0",
              "routing_cluster_id": "auth_required",
              "explainability_scores": null
            }

            ```

## Sample Inference (via FastAPI)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "claim_id": "12345",
    "cpt_code": "99213",
    "diagnosis_code": "E11.9",
    "payer_id": "AETNA",
    "provider_type": "Cardiologist",
    ...
  }'
```

  - ### Response:
            ```json
            {
              "denial_probability": 0.82,
              "likely_denial_reasons": ["Medical Necessity", "Prior Auth Missing"],
              "denial_cluster": "auth-required",
              "routing_team": "High Complexity A/R Team"
            }
            ```
## Streamlit UI

You can launch a local dashboard to triage claims:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Features
- Upload claims and run full prediction → cluster → route pipeline
- Visualize routed claim volume by team (bar chart)
- Explore denial clusters in UMAP 2D space
- Download results as triaged CSV

  - Runs at: `http://localhost:8501`
